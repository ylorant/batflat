Don't hesitate to open [pull requests](https://github.com/RomainOdeval/batflat/pulls).

* PHP 7.4+
* Usage of PSR-12 for PHP writing
* No usage of JQuery / remove all JQuery-dependant code
* No usage of NPM or similar tools. They are great but we want to limit dependencies as possible, like original project's spirit
* Software architecture (specially for JS files but not only) will change in the future but i have no fixed idea
